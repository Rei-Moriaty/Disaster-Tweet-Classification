# Disaster Tweet Classification


Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. A tweet could sount like disaster but it would actually just be exclamation of the scenic beauty like the one below

So to overcome this problem I have made which will take the tweet text and classify it has disaster or non disater tweet and then served it as an webapp. 

In the home page the the app takes some tweets in the from twitter and classifies it has disaster or non disaster in real time. Another page gives us a form where we can enter tweet text and it can classify as disaster or non disaster tweet
